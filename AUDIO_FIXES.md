# Audio Export Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed Volume Slider
- Removed the volume slider from ExportOptions UI
- Now uses fixed volume of 0.7 (70%) for all audio
- Simpler UX, less complexity

### 2. ✅ Fixed Test Audio for Custom Files  
- Test button now loads custom audio before playing
- Uses actual frame duration for testing
- Button is disabled when custom audio is selected but no file uploaded

### 3. ✅ Custom Audio Now Works Like Built-in Clicks (Sound Effect Mode)
The custom audio now behaves as a **sound effect** that repeats at each transition:
- **Audio is trimmed to frame duration** (e.g., 0.2s)
- **Plays at each image transition** (like clicks)
- **Works exactly like built-in click sounds**
- Supports MP3, WAV, OGG files of any length

## How Custom Audio Works Now

**Implementation:**
1. AudioManager loads the custom audio file
2. Creates synchronized audio track:
   - Trims audio to match frame duration
   - Places trimmed clip at each frame transition
3. Exports as WAV and adds to FFmpeg
4. Fixed volume of 0.7 (70%)

**Example:**
- 5 images × 0.2s frame duration = 1 second total video
- Upload 30-second audio:
  - First 0.2s is extracted
  - Plays at frame 0, frame 1, frame 2, frame 3, frame 4
  - Total: 5 short bursts of the audio
- Upload 0.1-second audio:
  - Entire 0.1s audio is used
  - Plays at each transition
  - Total: 5 bursts of 0.1s audio

This is **sound effect mode** - perfect for transition sounds!

## How Built-in Clicks Work

**Implementation:**
1. AudioManager loads `/click-sound.mp3` (same as preview)
2. Creates synchronized audio track with clicks at each frame transition
3. Exports as WAV and adds to FFmpeg
4. Fixed volume of 0.7 (70%)

This matches the preview sound exactly!

## Both Custom and Built-in Audio Use Same Logic
✅ Both use `AudioManager.createSynchronizedAudioTrack()`
✅ Both trim/use audio at frame duration
✅ Both repeat at each frame transition
✅ Consistent behavior across all sound effects

## Testing
- **Built-in clicks**: Matches preview sound perfectly
- **Custom audio**: Trimmed to frame duration, repeats at each transition
- **Test button**: Works for both built-in and custom audio
