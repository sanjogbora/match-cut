# Beat Detection Fix - Improved Sensitivity

## 🐛 Problem Identified

From user's console logs:
```
detectedBeats: 1  ❌ Only 1 beat found!
bpm: 120          ❌ Default fallback BPM
```

**Issue:** Beat detection was too strict, only finding 1 beat from the entire song. The algorithm would then extrapolate the rest using default 120 BPM (0.5s intervals), causing:
- Frame 1: 1.77s (to first beat)
- Frames 2-27: All 0.5s (extrapolated)
- Total: ~5 seconds (not synced to actual music)

---

## 🔧 Root Causes

### 1. **Energy Threshold Too High**
```typescript
// OLD: 70-95th percentile threshold
const percentile = 0.7 + (sensitivity * 0.25);
```
This was filtering out most real beats as "too quiet."

### 2. **Beat Refinement Too Strict**
```typescript
// OLD: Only 20% deviation allowed
if (Math.abs(actualTime - expectedTime) < medianInterval * 0.2) {
  refinedBeats.push(actualTime);
}
```
This was discarding beats that didn't perfectly match a regular tempo.

### 3. **No Debugging Visibility**
No console logs to see:
- How many raw beats were detected
- What threshold was calculated
- Why beats were filtered out

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Lowered Energy Threshold**
```typescript
// NEW: 50-90th percentile threshold (more sensitive)
const percentile = 0.5 + (sensitivity * 0.4);
```
**Why:** Lower baseline means more energy peaks qualify as beats.

### 2. **Relaxed Refinement Tolerance**
```typescript
// NEW: Allow 50% deviation from expected timing
if (Math.abs(actualTime - expectedTime) < medianInterval * 0.5) {
  refinedBeats.push(actualTime);
}
```
**Why:** Music often has tempo variations. 50% tolerance handles:
- Tempo changes
- Syncopation
- Human performances (not perfectly quantized)

### 3. **Skip Refinement for Few Beats**
```typescript
// If we have very few beats, don't refine - just return them
if (rawBeats.length < 4) {
  console.log('Too few beats to refine, returning raw beats');
  return rawBeats;
}
```
**Why:** Refinement was filtering out most beats when detection struggled.

### 4. **Comprehensive Logging**
Added console logs at every step:

```
🎵 Starting Beat Detection... {
  duration: "30.5s",
  sampleRate: 44100,
  sensitivity: 0.5
}

Beat Detection Threshold: {
  sensitivity: 0.5,
  percentile: "70th",
  threshold: "0.023456",
  totalWindows: 2645,
  minEnergy: "0.000123",
  maxEnergy: "0.156789"
}

Raw beats detected: 145
Beat refinement: {
  rawBeats: 145,
  medianInterval: "0.468",
  estimatedBPM: 128
}
Beats after refinement: 132

✅ Beat Detection Complete: {
  beatsFound: 132,
  bpm: 128,
  confidence: "85%",
  firstFewBeats: ["0.47", "0.94", "1.40", "1.87", "2.34"]
}
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Steps

1. **Upload music** with clear beats (hip-hop, electronic, pop work best)
2. **Check console** for new logging:
   - Should see `🎵 Starting Beat Detection...`
   - Should see `Raw beats detected: X` (X should be > 10)
   - Should see `✅ Beat Detection Complete:` with actual beat count
3. **Preview animation** - images should change on music beats
4. **Export video** - verify beat sync works

### Expected Console Output (After Fix):
```
🎵 Starting Beat Detection... { duration: "30.5s", ... }
Beat Detection Threshold: { ... }
Raw beats detected: 125
Beat refinement: { rawBeats: 125, medianInterval: "0.468", estimatedBPM: 128 }
Beats after refinement: 118
✅ Beat Detection Complete: { beatsFound: 118, bpm: 128, confidence: "82%" }

🎵 Beat Sync Enabled: {
  detectedBeats: 118,  ✅ Many beats!
  bpm: 128,            ✅ Real BPM
  imageCount: 27,
  frameDurations: [0.47, 0.47, 0.47, ...]  ✅ Varying durations
}
```

## 🎛️ Beat Sensitivity Control

The UI has a **Beat Sensitivity** slider (10% - 100%):

- **Low (10-30%):** Only very strong beats (kick drums, downbeats)
- **Medium (40-60%):** Most beats (default: 50%)
- **High (70-100%):** All beats including hi-hats, snares

**Recommended:** Start at 50%, increase if too few beats detected.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

Energy-based beat detection works best with:
- ✅ Electronic music (clear, consistent beats)
- ✅ Hip-hop (strong kick drums)
- ✅ Pop music (regular tempo)

May struggle with:
- ❌ Classical music (no clear beats)
- ❌ Jazz (irregular tempo)
- ❌ Ambient music (no percussion)

For difficult songs, use **Manual BPM mode**:
1. Look up the song's BPM online
2. Enable Beat Sync → Manual BPM
3. Enter the BPM value

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

If beat detection still fails:
1. **Increase sensitivity** slider to 70-90%
2. **Try manual BPM** mode if you know the song's tempo
3. **Check console logs** to see how many raw beats are detected
4. Songs with very low volume may need normalization first

The algorithm is now much more sensitive and should detect beats from most music!
