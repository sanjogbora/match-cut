# Beat Sync Fix for EDM & Fast-Beat Music

## Problem Summary

The beat detection was working for some songs but failing on EDM tracks like "The Death of a Bluebird" where:
- Beats are extremely fast and consistent
- Complex layering confuses onset detection
- Detected "beats" were actually random onsets (bass drops, snare hits, etc.)
- Result: Highly irregular frame durations (1.99s, 10.8s, 0.35s, 2.79s, etc.)

### Example of Bad Detection
```
Frame 1: 1.99s
Frame 2: 10.8s  ← Extremely long gap!
Frame 3: 0.35s
Frame 4: 2.79s
```

For EDM at ~140 BPM, we expect consistent ~0.43s intervals, not 10.8s gaps.

## Root Causes

1. **Essentia.js npm package not installed** - Using unreliable CDN loading
2. **No beat regularization** - Raw onset detection gives irregular timing
3. **Onset ≠ Beat** - Algorithm detected sound changes, not the musical pulse

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Installed Essentia.js via npm
```bash
npm install essentia.js
```

### 2. Fixed Module Loading
**Before:** Complex CDN polling that failed to initialize
```typescript
// Old: Polling for window.EssentiaWASM.EssentiaJS (never appeared)
```

**After:** Clean npm import with dynamic loading
```typescript
private async loadEssentiaFromNPM(): Promise<void> {
  const essentiaPackage = await import('essentia.js');
  const { Essentia, EssentiaWASM } = essentiaPackage;
  this.essentia = new Essentia(EssentiaWASM);
}
```

### 3. Beat Regularization Algorithm

**Key Insight:** Humans perceive a regular beat grid in EDM, even if onsets are irregular.

#### The regularizeBeats() Function

**Strategy 1: Check if beats are already regular**
- Calculate interval consistency
- If deviation < 50%, keep original beats

**Strategy 2: Create regular grid (for EDM)**
- Use detected BPM to calculate expected interval
- Find reliable anchor point (first beat after 0.5s)
- Generate perfect grid: `beat[i] = start + (i × interval)`
- Extends backward and forward to cover full duration

#### Example Output
```typescript
// Before regularization:
rawBeats: [1.99, 12.79, 13.14, 15.93, ...]
intervals: [10.8s, 0.35s, 2.79s, ...]  ← Terrible!

// After regularization (140 BPM = 0.429s/beat):
regularBeats: [0.0, 0.429, 0.858, 1.287, 1.716, ...]
intervals: [0.429s, 0.429s, 0.429s, 0.429s, ...]  ← Perfect!
```

## Technical Details

### When Regularization Triggers
- If max deviation from average interval > 50%
- Common for EDM, electronic, and complex layered music
- Preserves human-perceived beat grid

### Beat Grid Generation
```typescript
const expectedInterval = 60 / bpm;  // e.g., 60/140 = 0.429s

// Start from first reliable beat
let startTime = rawBeats.find(b => b >= 0.5) || rawBeats[0];

// Extend backward
while (backTime >= 0) {
  regularBeats.unshift(backTime);
  backTime -= expectedInterval;
}

// Extend forward
while (currentTime < duration) {
  regularBeats.push(currentTime);
  currentTime += expectedInterval;
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with EDM track** - "The Death of a Bluebird" or similar fast electronic
2. **Test with acoustic** - Should use original beats if already regular
3. **Test with variable tempo** - Rock/live recordings might need tweaking

## Console Logging

The fix adds detailed logging:
```
✅ Essentia.js Beat Detection Complete:
  beatsFound: 45
  bpm: 140
  
Regularizing beats:
  rawBeatsCount: 45
  expectedInterval: 0.429s
  
Regular beat grid created:
  beats: 60
  startTime: 1.50
  interval: 0.429
  
Beat regularization applied:
  originalBeats: 45
  regularizedBeats: 60
  intervalCheck: ['N/A', '0.429', '0.429', '0.429', '0.429']
```

## Expected Behavior Now

### EDM/Electronic Music
- Detects BPM correctly (e.g., 140 BPM)
- Creates perfect regular grid
- All frames have consistent duration (~0.43s for 140 BPM)

### Acoustic/Variable Music  
- If beats are already regular (deviation < 50%), keeps originals
- Only regularizes when needed

### Result
- No more 10.8s gaps between frames
- Smooth, musical beat synchronization
- Works like a human tapping along to the beat

## Files Modified

1. `lib/beatDetection.ts`
   - Added `loadEssentiaFromNPM()` method
   - Added `regularizeBeats()` method
   - Enhanced Essentia detection with post-processing

2. `package.json`
   - Added `essentia.js` dependency

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- User option to toggle beat regularization
- Visual beat grid editor for manual adjustment
- Multiple BPM detection for tempo changes
- Downbeat detection for phrase-level sync
