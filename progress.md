# Match Cut Generator - Development Progress

## Project Overview
A Next.js 14 application that creates smooth "match cut" effects by aligning faces across multiple photos using MediaPipe face detection and advanced image transformation techniques.

## Recent Major Updates

### 1. **Advanced Face Alignment System Implementation** ✅
- **Problem**: Simple eye-only alignment was insufficient for professional match cuts
- **Solution**: Built comprehensive 468-point facial landmark alignment system
- **Files**: `lib/advancedFaceAlignment.ts`, `lib/kalmanFilter.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Semantic landmark extraction with weighted importance
  - Procrustes analysis for multi-point correspondence 
  - Kalman filtering for temporal smoothing
  - Multiple alignment modes (full-face, feature-specific, expression-invariant)
  - Sub-pixel precision rendering with bicubic interpolation

### 2. **Two-Step Face Normalization Approach** ✅
- **Problem**: Complex Procrustes wasn't properly normalizing face sizes
- **Solution**: Simplified to proven two-step process
- **Implementation**:
  ```
  Step 1: Normalize face height (forehead to chin) → 60% of canvas
  Step 2: Apply eye anchoring for precise positioning → eyes at 40% from top
  ```
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Face height measurement using multiple landmark combinations
  - Eye-to-chin estimation (most stable method)
  - Enhanced debug output with 4 different face height calculations

### 3. **Enhanced Face Detection for Small/Distant Faces** ✅
- **Problem**: Many images with small/distant faces were failing detection
- **Solution**: Multi-strategy detection system
- **File**: `lib/faceDetection.ts`
- **Strategies**:
  1. **Original Detection**: Lowered confidence thresholds (0.5 → 0.3)
  2. **Enhanced Processing**: +30% contrast, +20 brightness
  3. **Smart Upscaling**: 2x upscale for faces <100px with coordinate adjustment
  4. **Best Face Selection**: Largest face area when multiple detected
- **Expected**: 75-90% reduction in detection failures

### 4. **Comprehensive Debug & Metrics System** ✅
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed face detection progression with emojis
- **Transformation Validation**: Scale factor analysis and warnings
- **Face Height Metrics**: 4 different measurement methods with comparison
- **Eye Alignment Tracking**: Original → scaled → target position tracking

## Core Technical Architecture

### Face Detection Pipeline (`lib/faceDetection.ts`)
```
Image → Strategy 1 (Original) → Strategy 2 (Enhanced) → Strategy 3 (Upscaled) → Strategy 4 (Relaxed)
                ↓                    ↓                    ↓                      ↓
           MediaPipe API        Contrast/Brightness      2x Scale Small       Last Resort
```

### Face Alignment Pipeline (`lib/advancedFaceAlignment.ts`)
```
MediaPipe Landmarks → Face Height Normalization → Eye Anchoring → Canvas Transform
      (468 points)         (60% of canvas)        (40% from top)    (setTransform)
```

### Key Files Structure
```
lib/
├── faceDetection.ts          # Multi-strategy face detection
├── advancedFaceAlignment.ts  # Two-step face normalization
├── imageAlignment.ts         # Original eye-only alignment (still used as fallback)
├── kalmanFilter.ts          # Temporal smoothing for jitter reduction
├── videoExport.ts           # Video generation from aligned frames
└── types.ts                 # Type definitions with confidence/timing metrics
```

## Current Status & Testing

### What Works ✅
- **Basic eye alignment** (original implementation)
- **Face detection** with multi-strategy fallbacks
- **Advanced alignment** with face height normalization
- **Preview generation** and animation playback
- **Export to GIF/MP4** formats
- **Comprehensive debug output** for troubleshooting

### What Needs Validation 🧪
- **Face height normalization accuracy** - Need to test with various photo distances
- **Eye anchoring precision** - Verify all faces have identical eye positions
- **Small face detection improvement** - Test with previously failing distant photos

### Debug Console Output Examples
```
🔍 Starting face detection on 1920x1080px image
✅ original: Found 1 face(s)
Face height metrics:
- Full (forehead-chin): 245.3px
- Eye-to-chin estimation: 187.5px (USING THIS) 
- Target: 432.0px
- Scale factor: 2.304
🔍 Transformation Validation:
- ✅ If scale > 1.0: Face was too small (far photo), scaling UP
```

## User Interface Features

### Alignment Mode Selection
- **🚀 Advanced Multi-Point**: Professional 468-point alignment with face height normalization
- **Smart Crop**: Face-region focus with eye alignment (60% padding)
- **Full Image**: Basic eye alignment showing entire photo

### Status System
- **Color-coded borders**: Green (aligned), Blue (processing), Orange (pending), Red (failed)
- **Confidence scores**: Display alignment quality percentage  
- **Processing times**: Show transformation duration (ms/seconds)
- **Error handling**: Detailed error messages with retry functionality

## Known Issues & Next Steps

### Current Limitations
- **Transformation accuracy**: Face height normalization may need fine-tuning
- **MediaPipe landmarks**: Some landmark indices (forehead/chin) may not be optimal
- **Coordinate systems**: Mixing normalized (0-1) and pixel coordinates needs careful handling

### Recommended Testing Process
1. **Upload diverse photos**: Close-up, distant, group photos, different lighting
2. **Check console logs**: Look for detection strategies used and transformation metrics
3. **Verify alignment**: All faces should have identical eye positions and face heights
4. **Test edge cases**: Very small faces, multiple faces, poor lighting
